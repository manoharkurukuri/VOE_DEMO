    The publisher drops an event on the queue and returns immediately. One or more
    background worker threads deliver each event to the registered subscriber, so
    slow work (scraping + LLM) runs off the request thread. Playwright's sync API
    needs a thread with no running asyncio loop, which these dedicated worker
    threads provide. Use ``workers > 1`` to process events concurrently.
